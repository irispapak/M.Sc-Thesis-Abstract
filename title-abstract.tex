In the current study the effect of spatial resolution in regional climate simulations is being investigated. The focus is on the added value of high-resolution climate simulations, which are performed in the framework of EURO-CORDEX. The analysis includes EURO-CORDEX simulations in three different domain resolutions: coarse ($\sim$50km), fine ($\sim$12km) and convective-permitting (hereafter CP) ($\sim$3km). The coarse and fine resolution simulations cover the whole European domain, while the CP is over the greater Alpine region.
%Two kinds of simulations are being explored$^.$ the first concerns the area of Europe in a resolution of 0.44\degree{} ($\sim$50km) with a nested domain in 0.11\degree{} ($\sim$12km) for the time-period 1990-2008 and the second belongs to the CORDEX-FPS framework and has a resolution of 0.15\degree{} ($\sim$15km) over Europe and 0.03\degree{} ($\sim$3km) over the greater Alpine regions for the time-period 2000-2005. The experiments have been performed with the WRF model and are driven by the ERA-Interim reanalysis.
An evaluation of the mean, maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation is performed, calculating basic performance metrics (e.g. bias) and identifying the regions which deviate from observed values. The evaluation datasets used in this study are: E-OBs v.19 for temperature and precipitation (12km), the MESAN reanalysis for temperature (5km) and the EURO4M-APGD for precipitation (5km).
% For the evaluation of the first simulation the E-OBs v.19 observational dataset is used, while for the second one the MESAN reanalysis dataset for temperature and the EURO4M-APGD for precipitation are used.
The results show that during the warm season in the finer resolution simulations at 12km compared to the coarser, the bias in maximum and mean temperature improves by 0.7\degree C and 0.3\degree C respectively, but deteriorates for minimum temperature by 0.3\degree C (over all domain). During the cold season, the biases differ only for mean temperature (deteriorate by 0.6\degree C in finer resolution), but for maximum and minimum temperature the absolute bias remains almost unchanged.
% The results show that from coarser (0.44\degree) to finer (0.11\degree) resolution there is a decrease in the absolute bias of maximum temperature (-0.7\degree C) and of mean temperature (-0.3\degree C) and an increase of minimum temperature bias (+0.3\degree C) during warm season. During cold season, the biases differ only for mean temperature (increase by 0.6\degree C in 0.11\degree), but for maximum and minimum temperature the absolute bias stays almost the same.
Concerning precipitation over the Alps, the biases don't change much at the CP domain (3km) when compared to the finer domain during winter, spring and autumn, but in summer the model becomes considerably drier (bias increases by 24\%).
%Concerning precipitation over the Alps, the coarser simulation's biases (0.15\degree) don't change much at the finer scale (0.03\degree) during winter, spring and autumn, but in summer the model becomes considerably drier (bias increases by 24\%).
